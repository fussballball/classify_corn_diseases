Example python code that classifies corn to diseases using an AI algorithm (Convolutional Neural Nets in this case).

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinadunk23/behzad-safari-jalal/ accessed: 7.12.2023
The resulting accuracies are between 95% - 97% (95% on Test dataset, which is also used in training; 97% on validation dataset, which is not used at any point during training)

Output can be visualized in confusion matrices or based on example images - see below for inspiration
